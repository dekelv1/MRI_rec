# MRI_rec

MRI machines are extremely expensive in part due to the perfect homogenic magnetic field that has to be generated inside them. In this project we create a pipeline that simulates a non-perfect MRI data by "spoiling" perfect data in a known manner, in order to the try to reconstruct the true, "perfect" field using existing methods in the literature.
